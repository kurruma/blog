      <<h2>Chapter 2: an introduction to quantitative trading</h2>

      What is the typical structure of a quantitative trading system?

      A trading system has 3 modules:
      Alpha model
      It is designed to predict the future
      Risk model
      Limit exposure to the factors that are unlikely to generate returns but could drive losses
      Transaction cost model
      It help us to know if we the cost can be greater than some small benefice and the impact transaction costs have on our strategy

      All those modules go into a portfolio construction model which interacts with an execution model. On top of that you need data and make a research on those information in order to set up the trading system

      Trend following strategy

      <<h1>Part two: inside the black box</h1>

      <<h2>Chapter 3: alpha models, how quants make money</h2>

      Alpha = value bring by the investor
      Beta = return that can attribute to market factor

      Types of alpha models, theory-driven and data-driven
      Theory-driven alpha model
      Most of the strategies are from the following ones
      Trend
      Reversion
      Technical sentiment
      value/yield
      Growth
      Quality
      Different type of data:
      Price-based
      Fundamental data

      1.1 Strategies utilizing price related data
      Trend following
      You look for significant move in a given direction in an instrument
      You can use moving average crossover (Ed Seykota)

      To earn 50 percent a year the investor has to be ready to suffer a loss greater than 50 percent at some point. And this is the case for all the major investment strategies.
      => The idea is to make enough money in the good times and manage the downside well enough in the bad times to earn money.

      Mean reversion
      One strategy is the statistical arbitrage

      Trend tend to occur over longer time horizon, whereas reversion tend to happen over shorter-term time horizon

      Technical sentiment
      It is expressed through price, volume and volatility behaviour.

      1.2 Strategies utilizing fundamental data
      To read: the cross section of expected stock returns
      value/yield
      To read: anomalies in relationships between securities' yields and yield-surrogates

      Quant long short strategy:

      QLS traders tend to rank stocks according to their attractiveness based on various factors, such as value, and then buy the higher-ranked stocks while selling short the lower-ranked ones.

      Growth/sentiment

      Quality
      All else being equal, buy quality assets and sell bad ones.

      Signals fall into 5 categories
      Leverage
      Diversity of revenue source
      Volatility of revenues
      Management quality
      Fraud risk
      Sentiment investor

      Data-driven alpha model

      1.3 Implementing the strategies
      Forecast target
      The first key component of implementation is to understand exactly what the model is trying to forecast. Models can forecast direction, magnitude, and/or duration of a mover and furthermore can include an assignment confidence or probability for their forecast.

      The signal strength -> you invest more on big signals

      Time horizon
      Differentiation is greater at shorter timescale than at longer ones.
      High frequency strategies
      Within the day
      Short-term strategies
      One day to two weeks
      Medium-term
      Few weeks to few months
      Long-term
      Several months or longer

      Bet structure
      First big choice = geography
      Asset class
      Instrument class

      Investment universe
      Model definition
      Conditioning variables
      There are two basic types of conditioning variables:
      Modifying conditioner
      It takes a given signal and changes whether or how it is used
      For example stop-loss is a common conditioning variable to pair with a trend following
      Secondary conditioner
      It requires the agreement (or some other condition) across multiple types of signals to trigger a tradable forecast.

      Run frequency
      An explosion of diversity

      1.4 Blending alpha models
      Linear models
      Idea = in linear models, the inclusion of one factor is independent of the inclusion of other factors, and each factor is expected to be additive, independently of the other factors hat might be included or excluded.

      Nonlinear models
      Idea = the relationship between the variables used to make forecast either is not independent.

      To read: The signal and the noise

      Chapter 4: Risk models

      Risk exposure generally will not produce profits over the long run, but they can impact the returns of a strategy day to day. Most importantly, the quant is not attempting to forecast these exposures, usually because he cannot do so successfully.

      So the key to understanding risk exposures as they relate to quant trading strategies is that risk exposures are those that are not intentionally sought out by the nature of whatever forecast the quant is making in the alpha model.

      4.1 Limiting the amount of risk

      Limiting by constraint or penalty
      Approaches to size limit come in two main form:
      Hard constraints
      They are set to draw a line in term of risk
      Penalties
      The further past the limit level we go, the more difficult it becomes to increase the position size additionally.

      Measuring the amount of risk
      There are two ways of measuring risk
      Volatility
      Measure the level of similarity in the behaviour of the various instruments within a given universe.
      This is frequently calculated by taking the cross-sectional standard deviation of all the relevant instruments for a given period.
      Dispersion = the correlation or covariance among the instruments in a given universe.

      Where limits can be applied
      The most common metric used is the Var but the autor is not convinced by this approach see later if it gives better metrics and why !!

      He recommends to allow the level of leverage to vary with the overall strength and certainty of the prediction from the alpha model, which seems a reasonable approach = the kelly criterion

      To read: John L.Kelly, the kelly criterion

      4.2 Limiting the types of risks
      Theory-driven risk models
      It is focused on systematic risk it is derived from theory
      Systematic risk = those that cannot be diversified away

      Empirica risk models
      It uses statistical analysis such as principal component analysis (PCA)
      It is usually used by statistical arbitrage traders

      4.3 Summary
      Risk management is frequently misunderstood to be an exercise designed to reduce risk. It is really about the selection and sizing of exposures, to maximizing return for a given level of risk.

      After all, reducing risk almost always comes at the cost of reducing return. So, risk management activities must focus on eliminating or reducing exposure to unnecessary risks but also on taking risks that are expected to offer attractive payoffs.

      Chapter 5: Transaction costs models

      Note that transaction cost models are not designed to minimize the cost of trading, only to inform the portfolio construction engine of the cost of making any given trade.

      5.1 Defining transaction costs
      Transaction costs have three major components:
      Commission and fees
      These are paid to brokerages, exchanges, and regulators for the service they provide, namely access to other market participants, improve security of transacting, and operational infrastructure.

      Slippage
      It is the change in the price between the time a trader (or a quant system) decides to transact and the time when the order is actually at the exchange for execution.

      Market impact
      The basic problem, described by market impact is that, when a trader goes to buy an instrument, the price of the instrument tends to go up, partly as a result of the trader’s order. If the trader sells, the price goes down as he attempts to complete his trade.

      Market impact is normally defined as the difference between the price at the time a market order enters the exchange and the price at which the trade is actually executed.

      5.2 Types of transaction cost models
      There are 4 types of transaction models.

      To model the transaction cost, you put the size of the order (in terms of dollars, shares, contracts, or the like) on the x-axis and the cost of trading on the y-axis.

      Flat transaction cost models
      The cost of trading is the same regardless of the size of the order

      Linear transaction cost models
      The cost of transaction gets larger with a constant slope as the size of the transaction grows larger

      Piecewise-linear transaction cost models
      This model is linear by part to reflect the quadratic curve

      Quadratic transaction cost models
      It is the most accurate model but the more computing intensive

      Chapter 6: Portfolio construction models

      Quantitative portfolio construction models come in two major forms.
      The first is ruled based. The second is optimized.

      6.1 Rule-based portfolio construction models
      Equal position weighting
      It is based on the idea that if a position looks good enough to own, no other information is needed in determining its size.

      There is a further implicit assumption that the instruments are homogeneous enough that they do not need to be distinguished on the basis of their riskiness or otherwise.

      Equal risk weighting
      It adjust the position sizes inversely to their volatilities

      Alpha driven weighting
      You determine position sizes based primarily on the alpha model

      6.2 Portfolio optimizers
      To read: Harry Markowitz “portfolio selection”

      Portfolio optimizers are based on the principles of modern portfolio theory
      P99 highlight

      The objective function is: maximizing the return of a portfolio relative to the volatility of the portfolio’s returns.

      Inputs to optimization
      Expected returns, expected volatility, and a correlation matrix of the various instruments to be considered for the portfolio.

      Expected return
      Comes from alpha models

      Expected volatility
      You can use different ways to model volatility (stochastic).

      6.3 Output of portfolio construction models

      Regardless of the type of portfolio approach used, the output of the quantitative portfolio construction model is a targeted portfolio, the desirable individual positions and the targeted sizes of each. This target portfolio is compared to the current portfolio, and the differences are trades that need to be done.
